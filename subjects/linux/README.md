## What is Linux?

<!-- slide-column -->

[Linux][linux] is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the [Linux kernel][linux-kernel],
an [operating system kernel][kernel] first released in 1991, by [Linus Torvalds][linus].

<!-- slide-container -->

It is based on [Unix][unix], an operating system released in 1971 at AT&T's [Bell Laboratories][bell-labs] in the United States.
As it was [proprietary software][proprietary], Linus Torvalds decided to release his own [open source][oss] kernel.

### Why use Linux?

There are many [reasons to use it][linux-pros]:

* Open source philosophy
* Low or no cost
* Better system stability
* Lightweight distributions (lower CPU/RAM usage & smaller size)

Some of these properties make Linux an ideal for:

* [Embedded systems][embedded] (e.g. [BusyBox][busybox] is only 2.1MB compressed).
* [Servers][linux-servers] (Linux is used as the operating system on more than 50% of all servers, and is used on most supercomputers).

> Note that no system is perfect.
> Linux also has [barriers to adoption][linux-cons],
> mostly the facts that it rarely comes pre-installed and that it requires users to know more about managing their operating system.

### Linux distribution timeline

Linux is not just one operating systems, it is a family of systems called [Linux distributions][linux-distros].
For example, on desktop or server, the most popular is [Ubuntu][ubuntu].
