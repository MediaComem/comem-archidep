## What is continuous software development?

### Continuous et al.

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a>]

Continuous software development is an umbrella term that describes several aspects of [**iterative software development**][iterative]:

* [**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration (CI)][ci]
* [**C**ontinuous **T**esting (CT)][ct]
* [**C**ontinous **D**elivery (CDE)][cde]
* [**C**ontinous **D**eployment (CD)][cd]

### The waterfall model

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a>]

Iterative development is a solution to the problems of the earlier **waterfall model** of software development.
In this model, progress flows in largely one direction through the phases of conception, design, implementation, verification and maintenance.

.grid-35[

The idea came from the manufacturing and construction industries,
and was initially applied to software development.

However, it makes it **difficult to respond to changes in requirements**.
If you are already in the verification phase, it's too late for new design and implementation.

### Iterative software development

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a>]

In contrast, iterative software development consists in developing software through **repeated cycles** (iterations) and in smaller portions at a time (incrementally).

<p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/iterative.png' /></p>

The planning, analysis, implementation, testing and evaluation **phases are repeated at each iteration** throughout the project.

#### Advantages of iterative software development

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a> > <a href="#5">Iterative software development</a>]

The main advantages of developing iteratively are:

* **User involvement:** the customer is involved at each and every iteration for planning and requirements,
  which makes it much easier to identify problems and react to changes in requirements.
* **Human resources:** less staff is required compared to the waterfall model.
* **Time limitation:** the first iterations can potentially be delivered within weeks while a waterfall project usually takes months.

### Agile software development

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a>]

[**Agile software development**][agile] is one of the most popular iterative development models.

It was popularized by the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development][agile-manifesto]
which describes the values and principles espoused by the model.
It has been adopted by many software development companies to improve the quality and speed of software.

There are various [agile frameworks][agile-frameworks] you can use to organize your work.
Each has a slightly different focus:

* [eXtreme Programming (XP)][xp] (focus on practices)
* [Kanban][kanban] (focus on workflow)
* [Scrum][scrum] (focus on workflow)

### What is continuous software development, again?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a> > <a href="#2">What is continuous software development?</a>]

To use agile software development or other iterative development models,
you **must be able to move and react quickly**.

Hence these various so-called "continuous" practices which help achieve this:

Practice                                  | Description
:---                                      | :---
[**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration (CI)][ci] | Regularly merge developer work to a shared mainline to avoid "integration hell".
[**C**ontinuous **T**esting (CT)][ct]     | Automate testing to reduce feedback waiting time for developers.
[**C**ontinous **D**elivery (CDE)][cde]   | Automate software delivery so that it can be reliably released at any time.
[**C**ontinous **D**eployment (CD)][cd]   | Automate software deployment to regularly provide new features to users.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a>]

[**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration (CI)][ci] is the practice of merging all developer work to a shared mainline regularly,
instead of having each developer work independently for days or weeks on end, and suffering when the time comes to integrate their work back into the mainline.

<p class='center'><img class='w80' src='images/git-workflow.png' /></p>

This is often managed with [version control][vcs] systems such as [Git][git].
A software development team may define a [workflow][git-workflows] determining when to merge work back into the mainline
(typically the `master` branch).



---
## Continuous Testing (CT)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a>]

[**C**ontinuous **T**esting (CT)][ct] is the practice of using automated tests
to obtain immediate feedback while developing instead of waiting for the Quality Assurance (QA) engineers to manually test the software.

.grid-60[

Software such as websites or mobile applications have traditionally been tested manually.
However, it **takes time to go through all possible paths** through an application and make sure it works.
Every time code changes, someone potentially broke something that a manual tester might fail to notice.

**Tests can be automated by writing them in code,**
increasing their speed and avoiding boring and repetitive click work for manual testers.

.grid-40[

.container[

Automated tests are often integrated into the continuous pipeline by running them automatically
every time changes are pushed to **version control**.

## Continuous delivery (CDE)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a>]

[**C**ontinous **D**elivery (CDE)][cde] is the practice of ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time,
usually by automating the building, testing and releasing of software.
This is often called a **deployment pipeline**.

<p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/continuous-delivery.png' /></p>



---
## Continuous deployment (CD)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Continuous Software Development</a>]

[**C**ontinous **D**eployment (CD)][cd] is one step further than [**C**ontinous **D**elivery (CDE)][cde]:
also automating the deployment of the software in addition to its delivery.

.grid-40[

To recap, continuous software development is the practice of regularly
integrating, testing, delivering and deploying software, usually through automation.

There are many tools to help you do this.
These are just a few examples:

Tool                   | Description
:---                   | :---
[Jenkins][jenkins]     | Open source automation server
[Travis CI][travis]    | Free continuous integration and testing service
[GitLab CI][gitlab-ci] | Continous integration and delivery service
[Codacy][codacy]       | Automated code review service
