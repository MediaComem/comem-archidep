## Group work

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a>]

This tutorial is meant to be performed by a group of two.
Throughout the rest of the document, the members of the group will be referred to as **Bob** and **Alice**.

The tutorial assumes that you have followed the [previous Git tutorial][git-tutorial] and have kept your calculator repository.

## Distributed version control system

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a>]



Working with remote repositories



---
### What is a remote?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a>]

A **remote repository** is a version of your project that is hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
You can have **several of them**.

Collaborating with others involves **pushing** and **pulling** data to and from these remote repositories when you need to share work.

<p class='center'><img src='images/remotes.png' width='70%' /></p>



---
### Centralized workflow

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a>]

There are [many ways][distributed-workflows] to work with Git as a team.
Here we will use a simple **centralized workflow**:

<p class='center'><img src='images/centralized-workflow.png' width='60%' /></p>

In this workflow:

* A **shared central repository** hosted on GitHub
* Each developer has a **repository on their local machine**
  * Each developer will add the shared repository as a **remote**



---
### Working with GitHub

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a>]

> "[GitHub][github] is a web-based Git repository and Internet hosting service.
  It offers all of the **distributed version control** and **source code management (SCM)** functionality of **Git**
  as well other features like access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project."

<p class='center'><img src='images/github.png' width='70%'></p>

---
#### Create a free GitHub account

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a> > <a href="#6">Working with GitHub</a>]

Both group members should register on GitHub:

<p class='center'><img src='images/github-account.jpg' width='100%'></p>

---
#### Create an SSH key

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a> > <a href="#6">Working with GitHub</a>]

To push code to GitHub, you will need to **authenticate** yourself.
There are two methods of authentication: HTTPS username/password or SSH keys.
We will use an **SSH key** for this tutorial.
You can check if you have one already with this command:

```bash
$> ls ~/.ssh
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
```

If you see these files, then you already have an SSH key pair (`id_rsa` is the **private** key, `id_rsa.pub` is the **public** key).

If you don't (or see a *"No such file or directory"* error), use this command to generate a new key pair (press Enter at every prompt to keep the defaults):

```bash
$> ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:ULmjUQDN4Snkh0s9u093mcva4cI94cDk name@host
```

---
#### Copy the SSH key

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a> > <a href="#6">Working with GitHub</a>]

To authenticate using your SSH key on GitHub, you will need to copy your **public key**.
You can display it on the CLI with this command:

```bash
$> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAEAQC+OMYWxBCiKa1lZuUc8sLcSBW17h
l4VTy9DaarFC98KxS3NQao/7+eMkOS3o1II4QL7pn7WMYITWpWP9UdJKNef/KQlTpS
1QVbhb6iJ2z2+GGt8+b0GvBRAZgab9TeOIrzN1QyknO4 name@host
```

---
#### Add the SSH key to your GitHub account

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#3">Distributed version control system</a> > <a href="#6">Working with GitHub</a>]

.grid-20[

<img src='images/github-settings.png' width='100%' />

<img src='images/github-settings-ssh.png' width='100%' />


]
.grid-80[

On GitHub, find the **SSH and GPG keys** section of your account settings and paste your **public SSH key** there:

<img src='images/github-settings-ssh-key.png' width='100%' />

(The title of the key is not important. It's useful when you have multiple keys, to remember which is which.)

## Sharing changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a>]



Clone repositories, push and pull commits



---
### Bob: create a repository on GitHub

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Bob** should create a repository from the GitHub menu:

.grid-20[

<img src='images/github-new-repo-menu.png' width='100%' />


]
.grid-80[

<img src='images/github-new-repo.jpg' width='90%' />




]
---
### Bob: add B as a collaborator

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

For this tutorial, both team members will need push access to the repository.
**Bob** should go to the repository's **collaborator settings**,
and add the GitHub username of **Alice** as a collaborator:

<img src='images/github-collaborators.png' width='100%' />

**Alice** must then **_accept the invitation sent by e-mail_** for the change to be effective.



---
### Bob: copy the remote SSH URL

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Bob** should copy the SSH URL of the GitHub repository:

<img src='images/github-ssh-url.png' width='100%' />

**WARNING:** be sure to select the **SSH** URL, not the **HTTPS** URL
(which might be selected by default).



---
### Bob: add the remote to your local repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Bob** should move into their local repository and add the GitHub repository as a remote:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects/comem-archidep-git-branching

$> git remote add origin git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git
```

It's a convention to name the default remote **origin**.

You can check what remotes are available with `git remote`:

```bash
$> git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git (push)
```



---
### Bob: push your commits to the shared repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

It's time for **Bob** to put the code in the shared GitHub repository.
This is done using the `git push` command:

```bash
$> git push -u origin main
Counting objects: 35, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.
Writing objects: 100% (35/35), 4.16 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 35 (delta 14), reused 11 (delta 2)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (14/14), done.
To github.com:bob/github-demo.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

The command `git push [remote] [branch]` tells Git to push the commit pointed to by `[branch]` to the remote named `[remote]`.

The `-u` option (or `--set-upstream`) tells Git to remember that you have linked this branch to that remote.



---
### Bob: remote branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

.grid-60[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-push' svg-height='300px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-40[

The commit objects and file snapshots have been **pushed** (or uploaded) to the GitHub repository.

This includes not only the commit pointed to by main, but also the **entire history** of the repository up to that commit.


]
.container[

Note the **origin/main** branch that has appeared in your local repository.
This is a **remote-tracking branch**.
It tells you where the **main** branch points to on the **origin** remote (the GitHub repository in this case).




]
---
### Alice: get the remote repository's SSH URL

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Alice** can now go to the repository's page on GitHub (under **Bob**'s account) and copy the SSH URL:

<img src='images/github-clone-url.png' width='100%' />

**WARNING:** again, be sure to select the **SSH** URL, not the **HTTPS** URL
(which might be selected by default).



---
### Alice: clone the shared repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Alice** can now get a copy of the shared GitHub repository on their machine.
This is done using the `git clone` command:

```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git
Cloning into 'github-demo'...
remote: Counting objects: 35, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
remote: Total 35 (delta 14), reused 35 (delta 14), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (35/35), 4.16 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (14/14), done.

$> cd github-demo
```

The `git clone [url]` command copies the **remote** repository to your machine.



---
### Alice: remote branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

.grid-60[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-pull' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-40[

The entire history of the project is **pulled** (or downloaded) from the GitHub repository.

Git will also automatically checkout the **main** branch in the working directory so you have something to work from.

Again, Git has created a **remote-tracking branch** in Alice's repository,
so that you can know what the current state of the remote is.




]
---
### Alice: make local changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Alice** thinks that the project's filenames are too long. Let's fix that:

```bash
$> mv addition.js add.js
$> mv subtraction.js sub.js
$> git add .
$> git commit -m "Shorter filenames"
```



---
### Alice: check the state of branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-commit' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

This is now the state of the shared repository and **Alice**'s local repository.

There is a new commit in **Alice**'s repository that is not in the shared GitHub repository.




]
---
### Alice: push to the shared repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

Push to update the shared repository:

```bash
$> git push origin main
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-push' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>



---
### Bob: check the state of branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

.grid-60[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-look' controls='false' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-40[

This is now the state from **Bob**'s perspective.

Notice that the new commit is in the shared repository (on GitHub)
but that the remote-tracking branch origin/main **is not up-to-date** in **Bob**'s repository.


]
.container[

Git does not automatically sync repositories.
**As far as Bob knows** looking at information from their local repository,
the main branch still points to `4f94ga` in the shared repository.




]
---
### Bob: fetch changes from the shared repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

**Bob** should now get the changes from the shared repository:

```bash
$> git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 2, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), done.
From github.com:bob/github-demo
   4f94ga..92fb8c  main     -> origin/main
```

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-fetch' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

The new commit is now here and the remote-tracking branch has been updated.

However, the local main branch **has not moved** and the working directory has **not been updated**.




]
---
### Bob: check the state of branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

Now you can use `git merge` like in the previous tutorial to bring the changes of origin/main into main:

```bash
$> git merge origin/main
Updating 4f94ga..92fb8c
Fast-forward
 addition.js => add.js | 0
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename addition.js => add.js (100%)
```

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-merge' svg-height='240px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

As expected, main has been fast-forwarded to the commit pointed to by origin/main and the working directory has been updated.

**Bob**'s repository is now up-to-date.




]
---
### Using git pull

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#11">Sharing changes</a>]

You can also use `git pull [remote] [branch]` to save time.

The following command:

```bash
$> git pull origin main
```

Is equivalent to running the two commands we just used:

```bash
$> git fetch origin
$> git merge origin/main
```

## Managing conflicting commit histories

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a>]





---
### Bob: fix the bug

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

**Bob** now notices that the last change breaks the calculator.
This is because the files were renamed, but the `<script>` tags in `index.html` were not updated.
Fix that bug, then commit and push the change:

```bash
(Make the fix...)
$> git add index.html
$> git commit -m "Fix bad <script> tags"
$> git push origin main
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-fix' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>



---
### Alice: make other changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

**Alice**, not having noticed the bug, proceeds to make 2 changes on `index.html`:

* Add an `<h2>` title before each computation
* Put the two last `<script>` tags on one line

```html
*<h2>Addition</h2>
<p id="addition">...</p>

*<h2>Subtraction</h2>
<p id="subtraction">...</p>

<script src="calculations.js"></script>
*<script src="addition.js"></script><script src="subtraction.js"></script>
```



---
### Alice: push the other changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

Commit and push the changes:

```bash
$> git add index.html
$> git commit -m "Improve layout"
$> git push origin main
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-fix' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>



---
### Rejected pushes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

```bash
To github.com:bob/github-demo.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-fix' controls='false' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

The push was **rejected** by the remote repository. Why?

This is the state of **Alice**'s repository right now.


]
---
#### Alice: fetch the changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a> > <a href="#32">Rejected pushes</a>]

Since Git tells Alice that the local copy of the remote repository is out of date, try fetching those changes:

```bash
$> git fetch origin
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-fetch-changes' svg-height='325px'></git-memoir>

---
#### Alice: try to push again

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a> > <a href="#32">Rejected pushes</a>]

```bash
$> git push origin main
To github.com:bob/github-demo.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:bob/github-demo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-fetch-changes' controls='false' svg-height='315px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

The push was **rejected again**! **Why?**

This is the state of **Alice**'s repository right now.





]
---
### Divergent history

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

.grid-70[

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-fetch-changes' controls='false' svg-height='325px'></git-memoir>


]
.grid-30[

It's for the same reason as in the previous tutorial:
**Bob** and **Alice**'s work have diverged from a common ancestor.

A remote repository will **only accept fast-forward pushes** by default.




]
---
### Alice: pull changes from the shared repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

**Alice** wants to fetch **and** merge the changes made by **Bob**.
Let's use the `git pull` command:

```bash
$> git pull origin main
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From github.com:bob/github-demo
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
   92fb8c..3ff531    main     -> origin/main
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

The fetch succeeded, but the merge failed because of a **conflict** on `index.html`.



---
### Alice: check the conflict markers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

**Alice** should take a look at `index.html`:

```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <script src="addition.js"></script><script src="subtraction.js"></script>
=======
    <script src="add.js"></script>
    <script src="sub.js"></script>
>>>>>>> 3ff5311406e73c7d2cc1691f9535214c2543937f
```

Let's make sure we keep it on one line while still renaming the files, and remove the conflict markers::

```txt
    <script src="add.js"></script><script src="sub.js"></script>
```

Mark the conflict as resolved and finish the merge:

```bash
$> git add index.html
$> git commit -m "Merge origin/main"
```



---
### Alice: check the state of branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

Now the state of **Alice**'s local repository is consistent with the state of the shared repository:
the commit pointed to by **main** is ahead of the commit pointed to by **origin/main**.

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-pull-changes' svg-height='325px'></git-memoir>



---
### Alice: push the changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

The push will be accepted now:

```bash
$> git push origin main
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='alice-push-merge' svg-height='335px'></git-memoir>



---
### Bob: pull the changes

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Collaborating with Git</a> > <a href="#28">Managing conflicting commit histories</a>]

**Bob** can now pull those latest changes to keep up-to-date:

```bash
$> git pull origin main
```

<git-memoir name='github' chapter='bob-pull-merge' svg-height='335px'></git-memoir>
