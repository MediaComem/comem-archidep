## What is SSH?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]



SSH is a **cryptographic network protocol** for operating network services
**securely over an unsecured network**.

Its main uses are **remote command-line login** and **securing network
services like Git or FTP**.

---
### How does it work?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#2">What is SSH?</a>]

SSH is a **client-server** protocol.

<p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/client-server.jpg' /></p>

Using an SSH client, a user (or application) on machine A can connect to an SSH
server running on machine B, either to log in (with a command line shell) or to
execute programs.

---
### How is it secure?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#2">What is SSH?</a>]

.grid-50[

**Step 1:** SSH establishes a **secure channel** using various **cryptographic
techniques**. This is handled automatically by the SSH client and server.


]
.grid-50[

<p class='center'><img class='w100' src='images/ssh-secure-channel-establishment.jpg' /></p>


]
.container[

.grid-100[

**Step 2:** The user or service that wants to connect to the SSH server must
**authenticate** to gain access, for example with a password.

<p class='center'><img class='w65' src='images/ssh-authentication.png' /></p>

**Step 3:** The logged-in user or service can do stuff on the server.

> Note that steps 1 and 2 are **separate and unrelated processes**.

## Secure channel

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

SSH establishes a **secure channel** between two computers **over an insecure
network** (e.g. a local network or the internet).

<p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/ssh-secure-channel.png' /></p>

Establishing and using this secure channel requires a combination of:

* [**Symmetric encryption**][symmetric-encryption]
* [**Asymmetric cryptography**][pubkey]
  * A **key exchange** method
  * **Digital signatures**
* [**Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)**][hmac]

---
### Symmetric encryption

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

[Symmetric-key algorithms][symmetric-encryption] can be used to encrypt
communications between two or more parties using a **shared secret**. [AES][aes]
is one such algorithm.

<p class='center'><img class='w80' src='images/symmetric-encryption.png' /></p>

**Assuming all parties possess the secret key**, they can encrypt data, send it
over an insecure network, and decrypt it on the other side. An attacker who
intercepts the data **cannot decrypt it without the key** (unless a weakness is
found in the algorithm or [its implementation][enigma-operating-shortcomings]).

---
#### Example: symmetric encryption with AES

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#6">Symmetric encryption</a>]

> **Windows users using Git Bash** may want to open a new shell with the command
> `winpty bash` before attempting to reproduce these examples. This is because
> of a [bug in Git Bash](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/540) which
> causes problems with some interactive commands.

Create a [**plaintext**][plaintext] file containing the words "too many secrets":

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects

$> mkdir aes-example

$> cd aes-example

$> echo 'too many secrets' > plaintext.txt
```

You may encrypt that file with the [OpenSSL library][openssl] (installed on most
computers). Executing the following command pipeline will prompt you for an
encryption key:

```bash
$> cat plaintext.txt | openssl aes-256-cbc > ciphertext.aes
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
```

---
#### Example: symmetric encryption with AES (decryption)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#6">Symmetric encryption</a>]

The resulting [**ciphertext**][ciphertext] stored in the `ciphertext.aes` file
cannot be decrypted without the key. Executing the following command pipeline
and entering the same key as before when prompted will decrypt it:

```bash
$> cat ciphertext.aes | openssl aes-256-cbc -d
enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:
too many secrets
```

> The `-d` option makes the command **d**ecrypt the provided contents instead of
> encrypting it.

---
#### Symmetric encryption over an insecure network

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#6">Symmetric encryption</a>]

Both parties must already possess the shared encryption key to perform symmetric
cryptography. It used to be **physically transferred**, for example in the form
of the codebooks used to operate the German [Enigma machine][enigma] during
World War II. But that is **impractical for modern computer networks**. And
**sending the key over the insecure network risks it being compromised** by a
[Man-in-the-Middle attack][mitm].

<p class='center'><img class='w90' src='images/symmetric-encryption-insecure-network.png' /></p>

---
### Asymmetric cryptography

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

[Public-key or asymmetric cryptography][pubkey] is any cryptographic system that
uses pairs of keys: **public keys** which may be disseminated widely, while
**private keys** which are known only to the owner. It has several use cases:

.grid-33[

**Encryption**

Encrypt and decrypt data.

<img class='w100' src='images/asymmetric-cryptography-encryption.png' />


]
.grid-33[

**Key exchange**

Securely exchange shared secret keys.

<img class='w100' src='images/asymmetric-cryptography-key-exchange.png' />


]
.grid-33[

**Digital Signatures**

Verify identity and protect against tampering.

<img class='w100' src='images/asymmetric-cryptography-signature.png' />


]
---
#### How does asymmetric cryptography work?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#10">Asymmetric cryptography</a>]

There is a mathematical relationship between a public and private key, based on
problems that currently admit no efficient solution such as [integer
factorization][integer-factorization], [discrete logarithm][discrete-logarithm]
and [elliptic curve][elliptic-curve] relationships.

Here's a [mathematical example][pubkey-math] based on integer factorization.

Basically, these problems allow a private-public key pair to have the following
properties:

* It is easy and **computationally economical to generate a key pair**.
* It is too **computationally expensive to find the private key** from its
  paired public key.
* Possession of the the private key allows you to solve complex mathematical
  problems based on the public key, thus **proving that you own that public
  key**.

Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; **the public
key can be openly distributed without compromising security**.

---
### Asymmetric encryption

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

<p class='center'><img class='w80' src='images/asymmetric-encryption.png' /></p>

One use case of asymmetric cryptography is **asymmetric encryption**, where the
**sender encrypts a message with the recipient's public key**. The message can
only be **decrypted by the recipient using the matching private key**.

---
#### Example: asymmetric encryption with RSA (key pair)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#12">Asymmetric encryption</a>]

Let's try encryption with [RSA][rsa] this time, an asymmetric algorithm. To do
that, we need to generate a **key pair, i.e. a private and public key**. The
following commands will generate first a private key in a file named
`private.pem`, then a corresponding public key in a file named `public.pem`:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects

$> mkdir rsa-example

$> cd rsa-example

$> openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.............++++++
.................................++++++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

$> openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
writing RSA key

$> ls
private.pem public.pem
```

> By convention, we use the `.pem` extension after the [Privacy-Enhanced Mail
> (PEM) format][pem], a de facto standard format to store cryptographic data.

---
#### Example: asymmetric encryption with RSA (encryption)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#12">Asymmetric encryption</a>]

Create a file containing your **plaintext**:

```bash
$> echo 'too many secrets' > plaintext.txt
```

**Encrypt it with the public key** using the OpenSSL library:

```bash
$> openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -in plaintext.txt \
   -inkey public.pem -pubin -out ciphertext.rsa
```

> This command will read the plaintext file `plaintext.txt` specified with the
> `-in` (**in**put) option. It will also read the public key in the `public.pem`
> file with the `-inkey` (**in**put **key**) and `-pubin` (**pub**lic **in**)
> options.
>
> It will then write the encrypted ciphertext to the `ciphertext.rsa` file with
> the `-out` (**out**put) option.

In addition to your key pair, you should have two additional files containing
the plaintext and ciphertext:

```bash
$> ls
ciphertext.rsa plaintext.txt private.pem public.pem
```

---
#### Example: asymmetric encryption with RSA (decryption)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#12">Asymmetric encryption</a>]

The ciphertext can now be **decrypted with the corresponding private key**:

```bash
$> openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in ciphertext.rsa
too many secrets
```

Note that you **cannot decrypt the ciphertext using the public key**:

```bash
$> openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey public.pem -in ciphertext.rsa
unable to load Private Key [...]
```

Of course, a hacker using **another private key cannot decrypt it either**:

```bash
$> openssl genrsa -out hacker-private.pem 1024
Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus [...]

$> openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey hacker-private.pem -in ciphertext.rsa
RSA operation error [...]
```

Hence, you can encrypt data and send it to another party provided that you have
their public key. **No single shared key needs to be exchanged** (the private
key remains a secret known only to the recipient).

---
#### Asymmetric encryption and forward secrecy

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#12">Asymmetric encryption</a>]

Asymmetric encryption protects data sent over an insecure network from
attackers, but **only as long as the private keys remain private**. It does not
provide **forward secrecy**, meaning that if the private keys are compromised in
the future, all data encrypted in the past is also compromised.

<img class='w100' src='images/asymmetric-encryption-forward-secrecy.png' />

---
### Asymmetric key exchange

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

So far we learned that:

* Symmetric encryption works but provides no solution to the problem of securely
  transmitting the shared secret key.
* Asymmetric encryption works even better as it does not require a shared secret
  key, but it does not provide forward secrecy.

Additionally, it's important to note that **symmetric encryption is much faster
than asymmetric encryption**. It's also less complex and can easily be
implemented as hardware (most modern processors support hardware-accelerated AES
encryption).

#### What can we do to improve upon asymmetric encryption?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#17">Asymmetric key exchange</a>]

.grid-60[

Ideally, we would want to be able to share a fast symmetric encryption key
without transmitting it physically or over the network. This is where asymmetric
cryptography comes to the rescue again. Encryption is not all it can do; it can
also do **key exchange**.

The [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange][dh], invented in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and
Martin Hellman, was one of the first public key exchange protocols allowing
users to **securely exchange secret keys** even if an attacker is monitoring the
communication channel.

#### Diffie-Hellman key exchange

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#17">Asymmetric key exchange</a>]

.grid-65[

This conceptual diagram illustrates the general idea behind the protocol:

* Alice and Bob choose a **random, public starting color** (yellow) together.
* Then they each separately choose a **secret color known only to themselves**
  (orange and blue-green).
* Then they **mix their own secret color with the mutually shared color**
  (resulting in orange-tan and light-blue) and **publicly exchange** the two
  mixed colors.
* Finally, Alice and Bob **mix the color he or she received** from each other
  **with his or her own private color** (yellow-brown).


]
.grid-35[

<img class='w100' src='images/dh.png' />


]
.container[

The result is a final color mixture that is **identical to the partner's final
color mixture**, and which was never shared publicly. When using large numbers
rather than colors, it would be computationally difficult for a third party to
determine the secret numbers.


]
---
### Man-in-the-Middle attack on Diffie-Hellman

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange solves the problem of transmitting the shared
secret key over the network by computing it using asymmetric cryptography. It is
therefore never transmitted.

However, **a Man-in-the-Middle attack is still possible** if the attacker can
position himself between the two parties to **intercept and relay all
communications**.

<img class='w100' src='images/diffie-hellman-mitm.png' />

---
### Asymmetric digital signature

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

One of the other main uses of asymmetric cryptography is performing **digital
signatures**. A signature proves that the message came from a particular sender.

.grid-70[

* Assuming **Alice wants to send a message to Bob**, she can **use her private
  key to create a digital signature based on the message**, and send both the
  message and the signature to Bob.
* Anyone with **Alice's public key can prove that Alice sent that message**
  (only the corresponding private key could have generated a valid signature for
  that message).
* **The message cannot be tampered with without detection**, as the digital
  signature will no longer be valid (since it based on both the private key and
  the message).


]
.grid-30[

<img class='w100' src='images/asymmetric-cryptography-signature.png' />


]
.container[

> Note that a digital signature **does not provide confidentiality**. Although
> the message is protected from tampering, it is **not encrypted**.


]
---
#### Example: digital signature with RSA (signing)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#21">Asymmetric digital signature</a>]

In the same directory as the previous example (asymmetric encryption with RSA),
create a `message.txt` file with the message that we want to digitally sign:

```bash
$> echo "Hello Bob, I like you" > message.txt
```

The following OpenSSL command will use the private key file `private.pem` (from
the previous example) and generate a digital signature based on the message file
`message.txt`. The signature will be stored in the file `signature.rsa`.

```bash
$> openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out signature.rsa message.txt
```

If you open the file, you can see that it's simply binary data. You can see it
base64-encoded with the following command:

```bash
$> openssl base64 -in signature.rsa
```

---
#### Example: digital signature with RSA (verifying)

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#21">Asymmetric digital signature</a>]

The following command uses the public key to check that the signature is valid
for the message:

```bash
$> openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.rsa message.txt
Verified OK
```

If you modify the message file and run the command again, it will detect that
the digital signature no longer matches the message:

```bash
$> openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.rsa message.txt
Verification Failure
```

---
### Cryptographic hash functions

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

.grid-55[

A [cryptographic hash function][hash] is a [hash function][hash-non-crypto] that
has the following properties:

* The same message always results in the same hash (deterministic).
* Computing the hash value of any message is quick.
* It is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying
  all possible messages (one-way).


]
.grid-45[

<img class='w100' src='images/hash.png' />


]
.container[

* A small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that
  the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value.
* It is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value
  (collisions).

SSH uses [Message Authentication Codes (MAC)][mac], which are based on
cryptographic hash functions, to protect both the data integrity and
authenticity of all messages sent through the secure channel.


]
---
### Combining it all together in SSH

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a>]

SSH uses most of the previous cryptographic techniques together to achieve as
secure a channel as possible:

<img class='w100' src='images/ssh-crypto.png' />

---
#### Man-in-the-Middle attack on SSH

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#25">Combining it all together in SSH</a>]

<img class='w100' src='images/ssh-mitm.png' />

---
#### Threats countered

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#25">Combining it all together in SSH</a>]

SSH counters the following threats:

* **Eavesdropping:** an attacker can intercept but not decrypt communications
  going through SSH's secure channel.
* **Connection hijacking:** an active attacker can hijack TCP connections due to
  a weakness in TCP. SSH's integrity checking detects this and shuts down the
  connection without using the corrupted data.
* **DNS and IP spoofing:** an attacker may hack your naming service to direct
  you to the wrong machine.
* **Man-in-the-Middle attack:** an attacker may intercept all traffic between
  you and the real target machine.

The last two are countered by the asymmetric digital signature performed by the
server on the DH key exchange, **as long as the client actually checks the
server-supplied public key**. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the server
is genuine.

---
#### Threats not countered

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#5">Secure channel</a> > <a href="#25">Combining it all together in SSH</a>]

SSH does not counter the following threats:

.grid-50[

* **Password cracking:** if password authentication is enabled, a weak password
  might be easily brute-forced or obtained through [side-channel
  attacks][side-channel]. Consider using public key authentication instead to
  mitigate some of these risks.


]
.grid-50[

<img class='w100' src='images/xkcd-security.png' />


]
.container[

* **IP/TCP denial of service:** since SSH operates on top of TCP, it is
  vulnerable to attacks against weaknesses in TCP and IP, such as [SYN
  flood][syn-flood].
* **Traffic analysis:** although the encrypted traffic cannot be read, an
  attacker can still glean a great deal of information by simply analyzing the
  amount of data, the source and target addresses, and the timing.
* **Carelessness and coffee spills:** SSH doesn't protect you if you write your
  password on a post-it note and paste it on your computer screen.
* **Genius mathematicians:** did you see [Sneakers][sneakers]?

## The `ssh` command

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

The `ssh` command is available on most Unix-like systems (e.g. Linux & macOS)
and in Unix shells on Windows (e.g. Git Bash or WSL). Its basic syntax is:

```
ssh [user@]hostname [command]
```

Here's a few examples:

* `ssh example.com` - Connect to the SSH server at `example.com` and log in
  (with the same username as in your current shell).
* `ssh jdoe@example.com` - Connect to the SSH server at `example.com` and log in
  as user `jdoe`.
* `ssh jdoe@192.168.50.4 hostname` - Run the `hostname` command as user `jdoe`
  on the SSH server at `192.168.50.4`.

Run `man ssh` to see available options (or just `ssh` in Git Bash).



---
## SSH known hosts

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

When you connect to an SSH server for the first time, you will most likely get a
message similar to this:

```bash
$> ssh example.com
The authenticity of host 'example.com (192.168.50.4)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:colYVucS/YU0JSK7woiLAf5ChPgJYAR1BWJlET2EwDI=
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

What does this mean? *I thought SSH was **secure**?*

---
### Are you really the SSH server I'm looking for?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#30">SSH known hosts</a>]

As we've seen, when SSH establishes a secure channel, a Diffie-Hellman
asymmetric key exchange will occur to agree on a secret symmetric encryption
key. To secure this exchange, the server will perform an asymmetric digital
signature so that no attacker can impersonate the server.

To verify the signature, **your SSH client will ask the server for its public
key**. **This is where a man-in-the-middle attack is possible.** SSH warns you
that someone is sending you a public key, but it has no way of verifying whether
it's actually the server's public key, or whether it's the public key of an
attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack.

Basically, **SSH makes the following guarantee**:

* Once you have established a secure channel to a given server, no third party
  can decrypt your communications. Forward secrecy is also guaranteed in the
  event your credentials are compromised in the future.

**SSH does not guarantee** that:

* You are connecting to the correct server. You may be connecting to an
  attacker's server.

---
#### How can I solve this problem?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#30">SSH known hosts</a> > <a href="#31">Are you really the SSH server I'm looking for?</a>]

If you are using SSH to transmit sensitive data, **you should check that the
server's public key is the correct one before connecting.**

One way to do this is to use the **key fingerprint** that is shown to you when
first connecting. The key fingerprint is a [cryptographic hash][hash] of the
public key:

```bash
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:colYVucS/YU0JSK7woiLAf5ChPgJYAR1BWJlET2EwDI=
```

Some services that allow you to connect over SSH, like GitHub, [publish their
SSH key fingerprints on their website][github-fingerprints] so that users may
check them. In other cases, the key may be physically transmitted to you, or
dictated over the phone.

You should **check that both fingerprints match** before proceeding with the
connection. If it does not, either you typed the wrong server address, or an
attacker may be trying to hack your connection.

---
### Known hosts file

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#30">SSH known hosts</a>]

If you accept the connection, SSH will save the server's address and public key
in its **known hosts file**. You can see the contents of this file with the
following command:

```bash
$> cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
example.com,192.168.50.4 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 eTJtK2wrRzhW5RQzUHprbFJa...
```

The format of each line in this file is `[domain],[ipaddr] algorithm pubkey`.

The line above means that when SSH connects to `example.com` at IP address
`192.168.50.4`, it expects the server to send this specific public key
(`eTJtK2wrRzhW5RQzUHprbFJa...`) using the [ECDSA][ecdsa] algorithm.

> ECDSA is another asymmetric algorithm like RSA, although ECDSA is based on
> [elliptic curve cryptography][elliptic-curve] while RSA is based on prime
> numbers.

---
#### Adding public keys to the known hosts file

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#30">SSH known hosts</a> > <a href="#33">Known hosts file</a>]

Another solution to SSH man-in-the-middle attacks when first connecting is to
put the server's public key in the known hosts file yourself.

If you have previously obtained the server's public key (the full key, not just
the fingerprint), you can **add it to the known hosts file** before attempting
to connect.

If you do that, SSH will consider that the server is already a *known host*, and
will not prompt you to accept the public key.

---
#### Preventing future man-in-the-middle attacks

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#30">SSH known hosts</a> > <a href="#33">Known hosts file</a>]

The known hosts file has another purpose. Once SSH knows to expect a specific
public key for a given domain or IP address, it will warn you if that public key
changes:

```
$> ssh 192.168.50.4
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:FUwFoK/hcqRAvJgDFmljwOur8t/mhfbm4tfIxdaVTQ==.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /path/to/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /path/to/.ssh/known_hosts:33
ECDSA host key for 192.168.50.4 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

As the message mentions, either the server changed its SSH key pair, or **an
attacker may be intercepting your communications**.

If you're sure it's not an attack, for example if you know the server actually
changed its key pair, you can eliminate this warning by putting the correct
public key in the known hosts file (or by removing the offending line).

## Password authentication

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

Establishing a secure channel is one thing, but that only ensures an attacker
cannot intercept communications. Once the channel is established, you must still
**authenticate**, i.e. **prove that you are in fact the user you are attempting
to log in as**.

How you authenticate depends on how the SSH server is configured. **Password
authentication** is one method. When enabled, the SSH server will prompt you for
the correct password; in this example, the password of the user named `jdoe` in
the server's user database:

```bash
$> ssh jdoe@192.168.50.4

The authenticity of host '192.168.50.4 (192.168.50.4)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:E4GYJCEoz+G5wv+EdkPyRLytgP7aTj9BS9lr1d38Xg==.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.50.4' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

jdoe@192.168.50.4's password:
```

> Most SSH clients will not display anything while you type your password.
> Simply press `Enter` when you're done to submit it.

## Logging in with SSH

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

If you run the `ssh` command with no extra arguments and authenticate with your
password, **SSH will run the default [shell][shell]** configured for that user,
typically [Bash][bash] on Linux servers:

```bash
$> ssh jdoe@192.168.50.4
jdoe@192.168.50.4's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-33-generic x86_64)

  System information as of Wed Oct 21 04:29:00 UTC 2015
  ...

$
```

> Note that you may have a different command line prompt once you are connected,
> in this example `$` instead of `$>`.

### Typing commands while connected through SSH

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#37">Logging in with SSH</a>]

You are now **connected to a Bash shell running on the server**. Anything you
type is encrypted through SSH's secure channel and interpreted by that shell.
Any data that Bash outputs is also encrypted, sent back through the channel and
displayed in your terminal.

<p class='center'><img class='w90' src='images/ssh-channel-and-processes.jpg' /></p>

### Disconnecting

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#37">Logging in with SSH</a>]

Disconnect with the command `exit` (or with `Ctrl-D` on Linux or macOS). You
should be back to the shell running on your local computer, with your usual
prompt:

```bash
$ exit
Connection to 192.168.50.4 closed.

$>
```

---
### Where am I?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#37">Logging in with SSH</a>]

Sometimes, you might forget what shell your terminal is connected to. Is it a
shell on your local machine or one running on the server?

If you're not sure, the `hostname` command may help you. It prints the network
name of the current machine:

```bash
$> hostname
MyComputer.local

$> ssh jdoe@192.168.50.4
jdoe@192.168.50.4's password:

$ hostname
example.com
```

In this example, the local computer is named `MyComputer.local`, while the
server is named `example.com`.

As you can see, the `hostname` command returns different results before and
after connecting to the server with SSH, because it's running on your local
machine the first time, but is running on the server the second time.



---
## Logging in or running a command

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

When you execute `ssh` with the `[command]` option, it will execute the command
and close the connection as soon as that command is done.

Run this from your local shell:

```bash
$> hostname
MyComputer.local

$> ssh jdoe@192.168.50.4 echo Hello World
Hello World

$> hostname
MyComputer.local
```

As you can see, you are still in your local shell.
The connection was closed as soon as the `echo` command completed.

## Public key authentication

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

Password authentication works, but it has some drawbacks:

* Attackers may try to [brute force][brute-force] your password.
* If an attacker succeeds in performing a man-in-the-middle attack (for example
  if you forget to check the public key the first time you connect), he may
  steal your password.
* If the server is compromised, an attacker may modify the SSH server to steal
  your password.

As explained earlier, SSH uses asymmetric cryptography (among other techniques)
to establish its secure channel. It's **also possible to use asymmetric
cryptography to authenticate**.

---
### How does it work?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#42">Public key authentication</a>]

If you have a **private-public key pair**, you can **give your public key to the
server**. Using **your private key**, your SSH client **can prove to the SSH
server that you are the owner of that public key**.

This has advantages over password authentication:

* It's virtually impossible to [brute-force][brute-force] (it is larger and
  probably has much more [entropy][entropy] than your password).
* Your private key will not be compromised by a man-in-the-middle attack or if
  the server is compromised, as it is never transmitted to the server, only used
  to solve mathematical problems based on the public key.

> Note that **public key authentication is only as secure as the file containing
> your private key**. If you publish that file anywhere or allow your local
> machine to be compromised, the attacker will be able to impersonate you on any
> server or service where you put your public key.

---
### How does public key authentication work?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#42">Public key authentication</a>]

To authenticate you, the server will need your **public key**. That way, you
will be able to prove, using your **private key**, that you are the owner of
that public key.

> Remember, **your private key MUST remain private** (i.e. the `id_rsa` file).
> You should **never** give it to any person, server or web service.
> Only give your public key (i.e. the `id_rsa.pub` file).

---
### Using multiple keys

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#42">Public key authentication</a>]

You may have multiple key pairs.

Some key pairs may have been generated by other programs or web services. For
example, some Git user interfaces generate a key pair to access GitHub, or
Amazon Web Services's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) generates key pairs to give
you access to their virtual machines.

Having multiple key pairs may be part of a security strategy to limit the access
an attacker might gain if one of them is compromised.

To generate a key with a custom name, use the `-f` (**f**ile) option when
generating the key with the `ssh-keygen` command. To use a specific key pair,
use the `ssh` command's `-i` (**i**dentity) option, which allows you to choose
the private key file you want to use:

```bash
$> ssh-keygen -f custom_key
$> ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key jdoe@192.168.50.4
```

> Note: it is the private key file you want to use with the `-i` option, not the
> public key, as the private key is the one your SSH client will use to prove
> that it owns the public key.

---
### Key management

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#42">Public key authentication</a>]

A few tips on managing your key pairs:

* You may disseminate your **public key** freely to authenticate to other
  computers or services.
* **NEVER give your private key to anyone**.
* Conversely, you may copy your private key to another computer of yours if you
  want it to have the same access to other computers or services.
* **Back up your private and public key files** (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) to
  avoid having to regenerate a pair if you lose your computer or switch to
  another computer. (If you create a new key pair, you will have to replace the
  old public key with the new one everywhere you used it.)
* Use [the `ssh-copy-id` command][ssh-copy-id] to copy your public key to other
  computers to use public key authentication instead of password authentication.

  > You will see how to do that in the SSH exercises.
* For web services using public key authentication (e.g. GitHub), you usually
  have to manually copy the public key file's contents (`id_rsa.pub`) and
  provide it to them in your account's settings.

---
### Key protection

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a> > <a href="#42">Public key authentication</a>]

It's good practice to [protect your private key with a
**passphrase**][ssh-passphrase]. You can enter a passphrase when generating
your key pair with the `ssh-keygen` command. You can also [add a passphrase to
an existing key][ssh-passphrase-add] later.

* **Without a passphrase, anyone who gains access to your computer has the
  potential to copy your private key.** For example, family members,
  coworkers, system administrators and hostile actors could gain access.
* The **downside** to using a passphrase is that **you need to enter it every
  time you use SSH**. You can temporarily cache your passphrase using
  [ssh-agent][ssh-agent] so you don't have to enter it every time you connect.

  <p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/ssh-agent.png' /></p>
* **If a private key is compromised** (e.g. your computer is hacked or stolen),
  you should **remove the corresponding public key** from computers and web
  services you have copied it to.

## SSH for other network services

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>]

As mentioned initially, SSH is a network protocol. It can be used not only for
command line login, but to secure other network services.

A few examples are:

* [**S**ecure **C**o**p**y (`scp`)][scp] - A means of securely transferring
  computer files between a local and remote host.
* [rsync][rsync] - Utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files
  across computer systems.
* [SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)][sftp] - Network protocol that provides
  file access, file transfer and file management.
* [Git][git] - Version control system that can use SSH (among other protocols)
  to transfer versioned data.
