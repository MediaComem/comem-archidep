# Git Branching

Learn how to work on isolated, parallel lines of development with [Git][git]
branches.

This is a condensed version of the [branching chapter of the Git
Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell),
which you should read if you want more detailed information on the subject.

This material is part of [architecture & deployment course](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-archidep) for [Media Engineering](https://heig-vd.ch/formations/bachelor/filieres/ingenierie-des-medias).


**You will need**

* A Unix CLI
* [Git][git]

**Recommended reading**

* [Version control with Git](../git/)

## What is branching?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a>]



<p class='center'><img src='images/commits.png' width='45%' /></p>

> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.



---
### Why use branches?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#2">What is branching?</a>]

Git has a very powerful branching model that is very **lightweight and fast**: it encourages workflows that branch and merge often.

Many teams using Git create a **separate branch** to develop **each feature**.
This has many advantages:

* Each developer can work on his own feature, **isolated** from changes going on
  elsewhere.
* Each developer can pull in changes from the main line **at their own pace**.
* The team can choose **which features to release** and when.



---
### What is a branch?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#2">What is branching?</a>]

Remember that Git stores data as a series of snapshots.

<git-memoir name='internals' chapter='internals' controls='false' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

Each **commit** (the circles above) contains a pointer to the snapshot of the
content you staged, represented by the blue **T**ree rectangles (as they
refer to a *tree* of file snapshots).

Each commit also contains:

* The user name and e-mail or the author
* The date at which the commit was created
* A pointer to the previous commit (or commits)

---
#### Branches point to commits

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#2">What is branching?</a> > <a href="#4">What is a branch?</a>]

A branch is simply a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit.

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='commits' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

The default branch is `main`.
The special `HEAD` pointer indicates the current branch.

As you start making commits, the current branch pointer **automatically moves** forward to your latest commit.



---
### Example repository

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#2">What is branching?</a>]

We will use a prepared repository to illustrate branching.

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects

$> git clone https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-archidep-git-branching.git

$> cd comem-archidep-git-branching
```

Remove the link to the remote repository (we will talk more about it in
[Collaborating with Git](../git-collaborating/)):

```bash
$> git remote rm origin
```

As you can see if you type `git log`, there are some commits already.
Open the project with your favorite editor and open the `index.html` page in a browser.

## Working with branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a>]





---
### Showing branches on the command line

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

The [`git log` command][git-log] can show you a representation of the commit
graph and its branches:

```bash
$> git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
 * 4f94fa (HEAD -> main) Improve layout
 * 9ab3fd Fix addition
 * 387f12 First version
```

In fact, this command is so useful you should make an **alias**, as we will use it a lot in this tutorial:

```bash
$> git config --global alias.graph "log --oneline --decorate --graph --all"

$> git graph
 * 4f94fa (HEAD -> main) Improve layout
 * 9ab3fd Fix addition
 * 387f12 First version
```



---
### Create a new branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** our JavaScript calculator is missing some code.
> Let's create a branch to implement subtraction.

It's very fast and simple to create a new branch. Run the following command to
create a branch called "feature-sub":

```bash
$> git branch feature-sub
```

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='branch' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

There is now a new pointer to the current commit.
Note that `HEAD` didn't move â€“ we are still on the `main` branch.

---
#### Showing the current branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#9">Create a new branch</a>]

You can use `git branch` without arguments to simply see the list of branches
and which one you are currently on:

```bash
$> git branch
 * main
   feature-sub
```

> The star is displayed next to the current branch.



---
### Switch branches

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

Now let's switch to the `feature-sub` branch:

```bash
$> git checkout feature-sub
Switched to branch 'feature-sub'
```

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='checkout' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

This moves `HEAD` to point to the `feature-sub` branch.

Nothing else happened because `HEAD` is still pointing to the same commit as `main`.

> **Exercise:** you can now implement the subtraction in `subtraction.js`.



---
### Commit on a branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

Once you're done, it's time to add and commit your changes:

```bash
$> git add subtraction.js

$> git commit -m "Implement subtraction"
[feature-sub 712ff2] Implement subtraction
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

As you commit, the current branch (the one pointed to by `HEAD`) moves forward
to the new commit:

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='commit-on-a-branch' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>



---
### Switch back to `main`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** oops, you just noticed that addition is not working correctly.
> You need to make a bug fix, but you don't want to mix that code with the new
> subtraction feature. Let's **go back to `main`**:

```bash
$> git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
```

---
#### Checkout behavior

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#13">Switch back to `main`</a>]

Two things happened when you ran `git checkout main`:

* The `HEAD` pointer was **moved** back to the `main` branch.
* The files in your working directory were **reverted** back to the snapshot that `main` points to.

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='back-to-main' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

You have essentially **rewinded** the work you've done in `feature-sub`, and are working on an **older version** of the project.



---
### Create another branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** let's create a new branch to fix the bug.

You can create a new branch *and* switch to it in one command with the `-b` (new
**b**ranch) option of the `checkout` command:

```bash
$> git checkout -b fix-add
Switched to a new branch 'fix-add'
```

<git-memoir name='branchingOneLine' chapter='another-branch' svg-height='137px'></git-memoir>

Nothing has changed yet because `fix-add` still points to the same commit as `main`.



---
### Work on a separate branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** fix addition in `addition.js` and commit your changes.

```bash
$> git add addition.js
$> git commit -m "Fix addition"
[fix-add 2817bc] Fix addition
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='divergent-history' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>

---
#### Divergent history

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#16">Work on a separate branch</a>]

Now your project history has **diverged**.

The changes in `feature-sub` and `fix-add` are **isolated**.
You can **switch back and forth** between the branches with `git checkout`.

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='switch-branches' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>

Every time you check out one of these branches, the files in your **working
directory** are updated to reflect the state of the corresponding commit, or
snapshot.



---
### Merging

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

Now that you've tested your fix and made sure it works,
you want to **bring those changes** back **into the `main` branch**.

Git's `merge` command can do that for you,
but it can only **bring changes** from another branch **into the current branch**,
not the other way around.

So you must first switch to the `main` branch:

```bash
$> git checkout main
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='fast-forward-merge-checkout' svg-height='200px'></git-memoir>

---
### Merge a branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

Now that you are on the correct branch, you can **merge** the changes from the
`fix-add` branch:

```bash
$> git merge fix-add
Updating 4f94fa..2817bc
Fast-forward
 addition.js | 2 +-
  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Notice the term **fast-forward**.

---
### Fast-forward

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

The `fix-add` branch pointed to a commit **directly ahead** of the commit `main` pointed to.
There is no divergent history, so Git simply has to **moves the pointer forward**.
This is what is called a **fast-forward**.

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='fast-forward-merge' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>



---
### Delete a branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** now that we've brought our fix back into `main`, we don't need
> the `fix-add` branch anymore. Let's delete it with the `-d` (**d**elete)
> option of the `branch` command:

```bash
$> git branch -d fix-add
Deleted branch fix-add (was 2817bc).
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='delete-branch' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>



---
### Continue working on a feature branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

> **Exercise:** let's switch back to our `feature-sub` branch and finish our work.
  Write a comment for the subtract function and commit your changes.

```bash
$> git checkout feature-sub
(Write your comment...)
$> git add subtraction.js
$> git commit -m "Comment subtract function"
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='work-on-feature-branch' svg-height='225px'></git-memoir>



---
### Merging a divergent history

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a>]

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='work-on-feature-branch' controls='false' svg-height='200px'></git-memoir>

Now that we're happy with our new subtraction feature, we want to **merge** it into `main` as well.
But the `feature-sub` branch has **diverged from some older point compared to `main`**, so Git cannot do a fast-forward:

* `feature-sub` points to commit `f92ab0` which contains our feature.
* `main` points to commit `2817bc` which contains the addition fix.
* Commit `4f94fa` is the common ancestor.

Git will do a **three-way merge** instead, combining together the changes of `main` and `feature-sub` (compared to the common ancestor).
A **new commit** will be created representing that state.

---
#### Merge commit message

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#23">Merging a divergent history</a>]

> **Exercise:** switch back to the `main` branch and merge `feature-sub` into it.

```bash
$> git checkout main
$> git merge feature-sub
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 subtraction.js | 5 ++++-
  1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Git will need to create a new commit when you run the `merge` command, so it
will **open the configured editor** (Vim by default if you have not changed it)
with a generated commit message:

```txt
 Merge branch 'feature-sub'

 # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
 # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
 #
 # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
 # the commit.
```

If you are in Vim, type `:wq` (**w**rite and **q**uit) to save and exit. If you
are in nano, use `Ctrl-X`.

---
#### Merge commit

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#23">Merging a divergent history</a>]

You can see the new **merge commit** that Git has created.
It is a special commit in that it has more than one parent:

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='merge' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>

---
#### Delete `feature-sub`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#7">Working with branches</a> > <a href="#23">Merging a divergent history</a>]

Now that you're done, you can delete `feature-sub`:

```bash
$> git branch -d feature-sub
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='delete-feature-sub' svg-height='275px'></git-memoir>



---
## Merge conflicts

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a>]

Occasionally, the merge process doesn't go smoothly:
if the **same line(s) in the same file(s)** was modified in two diverging branches and you merge them together,
Git can't know which is the correct version.

Let's pretend that a colleague of yours also implemented the subtraction function but in a different way than you did.



---
### Find the common ancestor

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

We want to make it look as if your colleague did his work **at the same time**
as you. Let's find the original starting point (the common ancestor where
`feature-sub` and `fix-add` diverged) and start a new branch from there.

```bash
$> git graph
 *   04fb82 (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'feature-sub'
 |\
 | * f92ab0 Comment subtract function
 * | 2817bc Fix addition
 | * 712ff2 Implement subtraction
 |/
 * `4f94fa` (origin/main, origin/HEAD) Comment add function
 * 9ab3fd Simplify addition and subtraction implementation
 * 387f12 First version
```

Make a copy of that commit hash.

> Note that the actual hash of the commit on your machine may be different than
> the one in this slide.



---
### Create a branch "in the past"

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

You can create a branch at any point in the project's history by passing an
additional commit reference to `git checkout`:

```bash
$> git checkout -b better-sub 4f94fa
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='checkout-past' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>

The `HEAD` has now moved to that point in the project's past history.



---
### Make a conflicting change

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Now edit `subtraction.js` and implement subtraction again, but in a different way.
For example:

```js
function subtract(a, b) {
  return -b + a;
}
```

Note that if you try to check out the `main` branch at this point,
Git won't let you do it because the state of `subtraction.js` is different in that branch:

```bash
$> git checkout main
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
  subtraction.js
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

Commit your changes:

```bash
$> git add subtraction.js
$> git commit -m "Implement a better subtract"
```

---
#### The state before merging

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a> > <a href="#30">Make a conflicting change</a>]

Viewing the graph of commits, it's clear that the change has been made **in parallel** with our earlier changes:

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='conflicting-change' svg-height='300px'></git-memoir>



---
### Merge the conflicting branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Go back to `main` and merge the `better-sub` branch:

```bash
$> git checkout main
$> git merge better-sub
Auto-merging subtraction.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in subtraction.js
Recorded preimage for 'subtraction.js'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Git tells you that a **content conflict** has occurred in `subtraction.js`.

The merge has failed and no new commit has been created.



---
### Check the status of the conflict

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Let's see what `git status` tells us:

```bash
$> git status
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   subtraction.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

* Git tells you that the merge is **not complete**:
  * You can either fix the conflicts and run `git commit` to end the merge, or
    cancel the whole thing with `git merge --abort`.
* `subtraction.js` was modified in **both** the **current branch** and the
  **branch we are trying to merge in**.
* You can use `git add` to **mark the conflicts in a file as resolved**.



---
### Inspect the conflicted file

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Let's see what's in `subtraction.js`:

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers a and b, and returns the result of subtracting b from a.
 */
function subtract(a, b) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return a - b;
=======
  return -b + a;
>>>>>>> better-sub
}

calculate('subtraction', subtract);
```

Notice two things here:

* Git has **successfully merged the comment** on the subtract function, since only one person changed these lines.
* Git could not merge the line with the computation, because the changes in the two branches conflict.
  It has added **conflict markers** to help you solve the issue.



---
### Conflict markers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Take a closer look at the conflict markers:

```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return a - b;
=======
  return -b + a;
>>>>>>> better-sub
```

* The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is the content that was present in the current branch (`HEAD`) before you merged.
* The section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> better-sub` is the content that is being merged in from the `better-sub` branch.

Since Git cannot know which is better, it's **your responsibility** to:

* Remove the version you don't want, and...
* Remove the marker conflicts.

```js
return -b + a;
```



---
### Mark the conflict as resolved

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a>]

Now that you have fixed the conflict, do as instructed by Git and add the file to the staging area:

```bash
$> git add subtraction.js
$> git status
On branch main
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

        modified:   subtraction.js
```

Git tells you that all conflicts have been resolved but that you still need to **commit** to end the merge:

```bash
$> git commit -m "Merge better-sub into main"
```

If you do not specify a commit message with `-m`, Git will generate one for you
and open the configured editor (Vim by default) for you to check and/or change
the message. Type `:wq` to exit from Vim or `Ctrl-X` to exit from nano, and to
make the commit.

---
#### The state after merging

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#27">Merge conflicts</a> > <a href="#36">Mark the conflict as resolved</a>]

Finally, delete the `better-sub` branch:

```bash
$> git branch -d better-sub
```

The latest commit on `main` now includes the changes from all lines of development:

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='merge-conflicting-change' svg-height='300px'></git-memoir>





---
## Merge file conflicts

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a>]

Sometimes it's not just the contents of the file that are in conflict:
you could have **modified the file** in your branch, and a colleague could have **deleted it** in another branch.
Let's again pretend to be another colleague starting from the same point:

```bash
$> git checkout -b cleanup 4f94fa
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='conflicting-file-change-checkout' svg-height='250px'></git-memoir>



---
### Make a conflicting file change

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#38">Merge file conflicts</a>]

This time, this colleague decided to delete `subtraction.js` in his branch because he doesn't like to see files with incomplete code:

```bash
$> rm subtraction.js
$> git add .
$> git commit -m "Remove incomplete implementation"
```

<git-memoir name='branching' chapter='conflicting-file-change' svg-height='300px'></git-memoir>



---
### Merge the conflicting branch

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#38">Merge file conflicts</a>]

Let's try to merge that branch into `main`:

```bash
$> git checkout main
$> git merge cleanup
CONFLICT (modify/delete): subtraction.js deleted in cleanup
  and modified in HEAD. Version HEAD of subtraction.js left in tree.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Git tells you immediately that there is a conflict and that:

* `subtraction.js` was **deleted** in the `cleanup` branch.
* `subtraction.js` was **modified** in the current branch (`HEAD`).
* Git **doesn't know** whether it should apply the deletion or the modification,
  so it left the modified file for you to check.



---
### Check the status of the file conflict

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#38">Merge file conflicts</a>]

Let's see what `git status` tells us:

```bash
$> git status
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)

        deleted by them: subtraction.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Again, Git gives us some information:

* `subtraction.js` was **deleted by "them"**, meaning that it was deleted in the
  branch you're trying to merge in (if it had been deleted in the current branch
  and modified in the other branch, it would be *deleted by "us"*).
* Use either `git add` or `git rm` to mark the conflict as resolved.



---
### Resolve the file conflict

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#38">Merge file conflicts</a>]

You have to choose whether you want to either:

* Keep the modified file (use `git add`), or...
* Remove it (use `git rm`)

Let's keep it:

```bash
$> git add subtraction.js
$> git status
On branch main
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
```

As instructed, use `git commit` to complete the merge:

```bash
$> git commit -m "Merge cleanup (kept implemented subtraction.js)"
```

Finally, delete the `cleanup` branch:

```bash
$> git branch -d cleanup
```

---
### Final state

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Branching</a> > <a href="#38">Merge file conflicts</a>]

And you're done!
