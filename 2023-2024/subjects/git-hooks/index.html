# Git Hooks

Learn the basics of Git hooks.

This material is part of [architecture & deployment course](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-archidep) for [Media Engineering](https://heig-vd.ch/formations/bachelor/filieres/ingenierie-des-medias).


**You will need**

* A Unix CLI
* [Git][git]

**Recommended reading**

## What is a Git hook?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Git Hooks</a>]

A Git hook is **an executable file** that can be **triggered when certain
actions occur**. Hooks can be any kind of executable file, e.g. a compiled
binary program, a shell script, a Ruby script, a Python script, etc.

Hooks must be executable files with a specific name in the `hooks` directory
inside a repository's Git directory (inside the `.git` directory in a normal
repository).

You can find example hook files in most Git repositores:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/a/git/repository

$> cat .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
...
```

> These example files are not triggered because they are not executable and do not have the right name.

### What kind of hooks are there?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#4"># An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.</a>]

Hook scripts must have a specific name (and be executable) to be triggered.

These hook scripts are only limited by a developer's imagination.
Some example hook scripts include:

Hook           | Example usage
:---           | :---
`pre-commit`   | Check the commit message for spelling errors.
`pre-receive`  | Enforce project coding standards.
`post-commit`  | Email/SMS team members of a new commit.
`post-receive` | Push the code to production.

You can type the `git help hooks` command to get the full list of hooks and their documentation.
A full list is also available [here][git-hooks].

### How can I create a hook?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#4"># An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.</a>]

Create a new repository:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects
$> mkdir git-hook-example
$> cd git-hook-example
$> git init
```

Create a hook script named `pre-commit` that will be executed before every commit:

```bash
$> echo '#!/bin/bash' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
$> echo 'echo You are about to commit...' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
$> chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

You now have a `pre-commit` hook script:

```bash
$> cat .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo You are about to commit...
```

---
#### Hooks are not under version control

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#7">!/bin/bash</a>]

Note that hooks are not part of the working tree and thus **cannot be put under version control**:

```bash
$> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

> This is a good thing, as you don't want people to be able to send malicious hook scripts to your machine
> every time you clone a repository from the Internet.

---
### How do I use a hook?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#7">!/bin/bash</a>]

Following the previous example, make a commit and the `pre-commit` hook will be automatically triggered:

```bash
$> echo content > file.txt
$> git add .
$> git commit -m "Test"

You are about to commit...

[main 14b306d] Test
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

---
### What are hooks good for?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#7">!/bin/bash</a>]

Hooks can be a way to automate repetitive or mundane tasks,
like removing trailing spaces at each commit.

Or they can be used to automate deployments,
for example to run the latest version of a server-side application every time new commits are pushed.
