# Deploy static sites to Netlify

The goal of this exercice is to deploy a **static website** (only HTML,
JavaScript and CSS) on the Netlify PaaS instead of your own server in the
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Microsoft Azure Web Services cloud.

### :books: What is Netlify?

[Netlify][netlify] is a popular hosting platform for static sites, which are
websites that are composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served to
the client exactly as they are stored on the server. Netlify provides a range of
features and tools to help developers build, deploy, and manage static sites,
including:

- **Continuous deployment**: Netlify automatically builds and deploys your
  static site whenever you push updates to a repository. This makes it easy to
  keep your site up to date without having to manually build and deploy it.

- **SSL/TLS certificates**: Netlify provides free SSL/TLS certificates (obtained
  from Let's Encrypt) to secure your site with HTTPS.

- **Global CDN**: Netlify uses a global content delivery network (CDN) to serve
  your static site from various locations around the world, which can improve
  the performance and availability of your site.

Overall, Netlify is a powerful and convenient platform for hosting and managing
static sites, with a range of features that make it easy to build, deploy, and
optimize your project.

You will be using the Netlify CLI to deploy your site. With the Netlify CLI, you
can create new sites, deploy updates to your existing sites, set up continuous
deployment, manage your team's access to sites, and more,  directly from the
command-line.

## :exclamation: Install Node.js and the Netlify CLI

### :exclamation: Install Node.js

For this exercise you will be using a command-line tool created by Netlify. You
will need to install Node.js to use this CLI. The easiest way to do so, is to
head to the [Node.js Downloads][node-downloads] and choose the appropriate
installer for your machine.

### :books: What is Node?

[Node.js][node] is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, rather than
just in a web browser. This enables the creation of server-side applications
with JavaScript, which was previously not possible.

Node.js also includes a large and growing library of open-source packages
(called "modules") that can be easily installed and used in Node.js
applications, making it easy to add functionality without having to build it
from scratch.

Node.js has become popular for creating web servers and building scalable
network applications, as it is able to handle a large number of concurrent
connections with high throughput. It is often used in combination with other
tools and frameworks, such as Express.js, to build web applications and APIs.

> :space_invader: Installing Node.js this way can cause headaches down the road.
> It is good practice to use version managers instead. One of the main benefits
> is the ability to easily switch between different versions of Node.js. This is
> particularly useful when working on projects that require a specific version
> of Node.js, or when testing how a project works with different versions of
> Node.js. A version manager also allows you to have multiple versions of
> Node.js installed on the same machine, which can be useful for developing and
> testing applications that need different versions of Node.js. Here are a few
> Node version managers:
>
> - [nodenv][nodenv]
> - [nvm][nvm]
> - [n][n]
> - [volta][volta]
> - [asdf][asdf] (also supports other platforms than Node.js)

### :question: Check your Node.js installation

To make sure Node.js is installed, try the following:

```bash
$> node -v
v18.12.1
```

### :exclamation: Install Netlify CLI using NPM

```bash
$> npm install -g netlify-cli
added 1437 packages, and audited 1438 packages in 15s
```

> :boom: See the troubleshooting section if you get an [**EACCES**
> error](#boom-troubleshooting).

:question: You can check the installation by executing:

```bash
$> netlify -v
netlify-cli/12.5.0 darwin-arm64 node-v18.12.1
```

### :books: What is NPM

[npm][npm] (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript.
It is the default package manager for Node.js. npm provides a way to install and
manage packages (libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) that you can use in your
own projects. When you install a package using npm, it installs the package in
the current working directory, in a subdirectory called `node_modules`. If you
want to use the package in your project, you can import it in your code.

In this case, you installed a global module, since you want to access the
Netlify CLI from anywhere. Global modules are installed globally, which means
they are available to use in any project on your computer. You can install a
global module using the `-g` or `--global` option of the `npm install` command.

### :exclamation: Authenticate Netlify CLI

You need to link the Netlify CLI to your Netlify account. To do so, run:

```bash
$> netlify login
Logging into your Netlify account...
Opening https://app.netlify.com/authorize?response_type=ticket&ticket=0b81336689cba2392265b135549df0e7
â ´ Waiting for authorization...
```
This will open a page in your browser window asking you to authorize the Netlify CLI to access your account:

![Link Netlify and Netlify CLI](../images/netlify-authorize.png)

Once you click **authorize**, you should see the following in your Terminal:

```bash
You are now logged into your Netlify account!
Run netlify status for account details
To see all available commands run: netlify help
```

## :exclamation: Launch!

Make sure you are in the `static-clock-website` directory and run:
```bash
$> netlify init
```

Follow the configuration assistant by reading carefully and entering the
relevant options. At some point, a GitHub authorization page will open in your
browser.

:warning: **Use the default options except for the site name.** The site name
must be unique across all Netlify deployments, so you must choose a name that
has not already been used by someone else.

```bash
? What would you like to do? +  Create & configure a new site
? Team: JohnDoe's team
? Site name (leave blank for a random name; you can change it later): john-doe-static-clock-website

Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/static-clock-website
URL:       https://static-clock-website.netlify.app
Site ID:   690799cd-e26f-4625-9f1e-257cdba76e87

Linked to static-clock-website

(node:57377) ExperimentalWarning: The Fetch API is an experimental feature. This feature could change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
? Your build command (hugo build/yarn run build/etc): # no build command
? Directory to deploy (blank for current dir): .
? No netlify.toml detected. Would you like to create one with these build settings? Yes

Adding deploy key to repository...
Deploy key added!

Creating Netlify GitHub Notification Hooks...
Netlify Notification Hooks configured!

Success! Netlify CI/CD Configured!

This site is now configured to automatically deploy from github branches & pull requests

Next steps:

  git push       Push to your git repository to trigger new site builds
  netlify open   Open the Netlify admin URL of your site
```

If you visit the **URL** printed in your terminal, you should be able to witness
the static clock website up and running!

### :question: Push a change and witness continuous deployment!

Open the `static-clock-website` website in your code editor and make a change.
For example, change the `background-color` property on the `<body>` element in
the `style.css` file.

Stage, commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository:

```bash
$> git add .
$> git commit -m "New body background color"
$> git push
```

After a few seconds, the changes should be visible at the Netlify URL!

## :checkered_flag: What have I done?

In this exercise, you deployed a static website to Netlify PaaS using the
Netlify CLI. Netlify automatically configured the following stuff for you:

- Hosting
- Reverse proxying
- TLS/SSL encryption
- Automated deployments
- Domain name

Pretty cool, for the price of **free**. We have just scratched the surface of
what Netlify can do, so feel free to explore the platform further.

## :boom: Troubleshooting

Here's a few tips about some problems you may encounter during this exercise.

### :boom: **EACCESS** error

If you get an **EACCES** error when running an `npm install` command with the
`-g` or `--global` option, it may be because the default global installation
directory used by Node.js is owned by `root`.

Execute the following commands to switch to a directory owned by you:

```bash
$> mkdir ~/.npm-global
$> npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
$> echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Re-launch your terminal to take the changes to your PATH into account. The `npm
install` command which previously failed should now work.
