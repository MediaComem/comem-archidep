# Clone a repository from a server

<!-- START doctoc -->
<!-- END doctoc -->

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to retrieve a project's source code with Git while connected to a remote server.

Perform the following tasks:

* Connect to the `archidep.tech` exercise server with SSH.
* Clone your team's solution repository from the collaborative exercise somewhere in your home directory.
  * If you have not completed the collaborative exercise, you can try doing the same with the [base repository](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-archidep-php-todo-exercise).
