## Setup

Make sure you have done the [previous exercise](config-through-environment.md).

Stop your `php -S` command if it is still running.



## Create a systemd unit configuration file

Copy the following configuration, replacing the following values:

* Replace `john_doe` by your username on your server.
* Replace `/home/john_doe` by your home directory on your server.

```
[Unit]
Description=PHP TodoList
After=mysql.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php -S 0.0.0.0:3000
User=john_doe
WorkingDirectory=/home/john_doe/todolist-repo
Environment=TODOLIST_DB_PASS=chAngeMeN0w!
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it to `/etc/systemd/system/todolist.service` on the server.

> You can edit this file with `nano` on the server with the following command:
> `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/todolist.service`.



## Enable and start the todolist service

Enable and start your new service:

```bash
$> sudo systemctl enable todolist
$> sudo systemctl start todolist
```

Make sure it is running:

```bash
$> sudo systemctl status todolist
```

You should be able to access the running todolist application in your browser on your server's IP address and port 3000.



## Reboot and try again

Reboot your server:

```bash
$> sudo reboot
```

The todolist application should still be running:

```bash
$> sudo systemctl status todolist
```



## End result
